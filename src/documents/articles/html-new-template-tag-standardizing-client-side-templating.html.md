templating languages/engines like Django (Python), ERB/Haml (Ruby), and Smarty
(PHP) have been around for a long time. In the last couple of years however,
we've seen an explosion of MVC frameworks spring up. All of them are slightly
different, yet most share a common mechanic for rendering their presentational
layer (aka da view): templates.
