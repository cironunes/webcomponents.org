Web Components have come a long way in the past few months and one of the
technologies that I’m most interested in is HTML Imports (or “imports”, for
short). Imports allow you to load additional documents into your page without
having to write a bunch of ajax. This is great for Custom Elements where you
might want to import a suite of new tags. I spent the day playing with imports
and thought it would be useful to write up my progress.
